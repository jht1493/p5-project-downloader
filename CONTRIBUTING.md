# Contribution guide

**I invite anyone to get involved with the future development of this app. Don't be afraid to make mistakes and ask for help when you need it.**

This area is unfinished. Feel free to contribute in writing a contribution guide. The plan is to include the following sections:

- Translating
  - The app by editing src/content.js
  - The documentation by adding translations of README, CONTRIBUTION GUIDE, etc. to project root. Filename should be appended with two letter country codes (e.g. README_FI).
- Reporting issues (issues tab), suggesting new ideas (discussions tab), fixing issues (issue + pull request)
- File structure
- Dev setup instructions
  - fork
  - git clone
  - npm install && (cd server && npm install)
  - npm run dev
  - edit code
  - git push
  - pull request
- Adding name to contributors.js (list of contributrs will be loaded to the bottom of the app UI in the future)
